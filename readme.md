This project is a simple customer, product and sales registration system. 

The objective of this project is to show my skills in developing web systems using Laravel, sqlite database, blade template and javascript.

This system lists all registered products on the home page, at the top the user has access to the menu where it is possible to register, list registered items, edit and delete customer data, product, product images. The part of the orders is still only possible to register and list the orders.

to use the system it is necessary to have composer installed on the computer. With composer installed, download the project to the machine in the location of your choice and unzip it into a folder. With the project unzipped, open the terminal, access the directory where the project is located and type the command npm install, it will install all the necessary dependencies for the execution of the project. After completing the installation, just type the command php artisa serve and the system will be running, now just access the browser and enter the address localhost:8000.
